# South African TB Hotspot Model

## Synopsis

This R project contains a matematical model to study the effect of certain public health interventions on tuberculosis (TB) dynamics between the general community and a presumed hotpot. The current implementation of this model is deterministic. 

## Motivation

This project was started as an assignment in the 2015 offering of Infectious Disease Dynamics at The Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health. The course instructors were Justin Lessler, PhD and Derek Cummings, PhD. This repository seeks to expand the work created and submitted under the requirements for the assignment. 

The model is based on the TB model described by Dowdy et al. in "Heterogeneity in tuberculosis transmission and the role of geographic hotspots in propagating epidemics."
